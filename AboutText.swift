The detector system has no direct knowledge of objects in the world (donuts, bananas, skateboards, wine glasses, etc) as we know them. Instead, the detector maps patterns received on the signal line to a sequence of word-choice probability distributions and assembles an output stream. The internal routing through this artificial neural network is largely meaningless to a human observer. Nonetheless, it works (sometimes)!</p>" +
